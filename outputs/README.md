This folder contains the unprocessed output files generated by running the PETase (PDB: 5XJH) query through the ThermoSeek web platform. These results illustrate the use of ThermoSeek for:

Motif Search

Fold Search

Sequence Alignment

All outputs are directly exported from the ThermoSeek modules and have not been modified or post-processed.

📄 File Descriptions

🧬 Fold Search
PETase_5XJH_Thermo_fold_search_result.csv
→ Main result table with TM-score, alignment length, Uniprot IDs, and structural matches.

PETase_5XJH_Thermo_fold_search_result.html
→ Interactive HTML file from Foldseek for visualizing structural alignments.

PETase_5XJH_fold_search_15_thermo.fasta
→ FASTA file of top fold-aligned sequences.

PETase_5XJH_fold_search_15_thermo_MSA.fasta
→ Multiple sequence alignment(MSA) of top structural matches.

🔍 Sequence Alignment
PETase_5XJH_blast_6_thermo.fasta
→ Top 6 BLAST hits in FASTA format from the thermophilic database.

PETase_5XJH_blast_6_thermo_MSA.fasta
→ MSA file for the top BLAST hits.

PETase_Thermo_blast.csv
→ CSV table of BLAST alignment results.

PETase_Thermo_blast.pairwise

🧾 Notes
These outputs correspond to the real case study of PETase reported in our publication.

They are provided as-is to help users understand ThermoSeek output formats and benchmark their own protein analyses.

Use these results as a template for interpreting ThermoSeek-generated outputs across different modules.
