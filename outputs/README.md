 Example Case: PETase Structural and Sequence Analysis
This repository includes a complete example from our publication, illustrating the use of ThermoSeek for motif search, fold search, and sequence alignment on PETase, a plastic-degrading enzyme.

📁 Folder contents:

output/ – Contains unprocessed raw outputs directly generated from ThermoSeek, including:

Result tables (e.g., motif search .csv, alignment hit lists)

Foldseek output files and optional HTML visualizations

BLAST/MMseqs2 alignment results

🧾 These files represent real data from the published PETase case study and are provided as-is, without post-processing. They serve as a reference template for users to prepare input files and interpret output formats for their own protein analysis tasks using ThermoSeek.
