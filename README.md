# ThermoSeek
An Integrated Web Resource for Sequence and Structural Analysis of Proteins from Thermophilic Species
The ThermoSeek web application is publicly available at https://protein.org.cn/thermoseek. The underlying data and software supporting ThermoSeek are also publicly accessible:
Data: The protein sequences and predicted structures integrated into ThermoSeek are sourced from publicly available databases, including the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/). These datasets are accessible through the ThermoSeek platform.
Software: The ThermoSeek database is built using the following tools: Fpocket v2.0 (https://github.com/Discngine/fpocket), NCBI BLAST 2.13.0+ (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/), MMseqs2 (https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2), and Foldseek (https://github.com/steineggerlab/foldseek).
